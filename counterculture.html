		<p>The counterculture of the 1960’s was a cultural phenomenon that developed in the United States early in the decade, gaining momentum during government intervention in Vietnam.  As the 60’s progressed, tensions developed in American Society and to flow along generational lines regarding the war in Vietnam, race relations, sexual mores, women’s rights, traditional modes of authority, and differing interpretations of the American Dream.  New cultural forms were beginning to emerge including the rise of hippie culture, which led to the rapid evolution of a youth subculture that emphasized change and experimentation.</p>
			
	<p>The hippies were San Francisco’s flower children, who adopted a new style of dress, experimented with psychedelic drugs, lived communally and developed a vibrant music scene.  They rejected active political engagement with the mainstream and hoped to change society by dropping out of it. As members of the hippie movement grew older and moderated their lives and their views, and especially after US involvement in the Vietnam War ended in the mid-1970s, the counterculture was largely absorbed by the mainstream, leaving a lasting impact on philosophy, morality, music, art, alternative health and diet, lifestyle and fashion.</p>
	
		<p>Another group of casual LSD users evolved and expanded into a subculture that extolled the mystical and religious symbolism often engendered by the drug's powerful effects, and advocated its use as a method of raising consciousness.  The Grateful Dead were among these personalities, and attracted a great deal of publicity, generating further interest in LSD.</p>
		
		<p> The early music of the Grateful Dead was part of the process of establishing what psychedelic music was.  Their psychedelic sound was developed after meeting Ken Kesey, an American author in Palo Alto and becoming the house band for the Acid Tests he staged.  These were a series of parties centered around the use of, experimentation with, and advocacy of the psychedelic drug LSD, also known as acid, which at that time was legal.</p>
		
		<p>The band dedicated their time and talents to their community, the Haight-Ashbury area of San Francisco, making available free food, lodging, music and health care to all comers; they were the &quot;first among equals in giving unselfishly of themselves to hippie culture, performing 'more free concerts than any band in the history of music. </p>

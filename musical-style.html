		<p>The Grateful Dead is known for their unique and eclectic style, which fuses together elements of rock, folk, bluegrass, blues, reggae, and country, and could not fit their sound into any of these established categories, but rather bridged all areas.  Individual tunes within their repertoire could be identified under one of these stylistic labels, but overall their music drew on all of these genres and more, frequently melding several of them</p>
		<p>The live shows, fed by their improvisational approach to music, made the Grateful Dead different from most other touring bands.  While most rock and roll bands rehearse a standard show for their tours that is replayed night after night across a plethora of different cities, the Grateful Dead never did.  Rather than practice and prepare, the Dead embraced innovation, flexibility, and improvisation.  As Garcia stated in a 1966 interview, &quot;We don't make up our sets beforehand. We'd rather work off the tops of our heads than off a piece of paper.” For each performance, the band drew material from an active list of a hundred or so songs, performing an original version each time.  Their beloved song “Dark Star,” for instance, was released as a single in 1968 as less than three minutes long, yet in concert it could last anywhere from fifteen to forty five minutes.  As the band and its sound matured over thirty years of touring, playing, and recording, each member’s style contribution became more defined, consistent, and identifiable.</p>
		
			<p>Not only was the syle of the Grateful Dead completely unique, they adopted a unique business model as well, one that is followed by nearly every up-and-coming band working today.  Facing tremendous financial pressure from their extensive staff, who they paid generous wages, starting their own record label, and investing in cutting-edge sound systems, the Dead were forced to come up with something new.  They used touring as the primary technique to make money, attracting big crowds to live shows, though never producing the actual record sales to match because their improvisations on stage did not translate well onto vinyl. Touring consistently throughout their career, and playing more than 2300 concerts, relentless touring was the best thing that could have happened to them.  The members all loved touring, and it especially helped them keep in touch with their fans.  Unable to make money, the Dead stayed agile, and through adjusting, established a revolutionary new business model.</p>
			
		<p>Sound Systems: The Dead was chiefly concerned with improving their amplified sound and was never satisfied with the house system anywhere they played.Because of the lack of equipment makers in the market however, this forced the Dead to create their own.  Pursing a goal of a sound system that was transparent, clear, undistorted, and very loud, soundman Owsley “Bear” Stanley created “The Wall of Sound.” It consisted of 604 speakers drawing 26, 400 watts of power from 55 amplifiers of 600 watts.  Each instrument had its own column of speakers, with a cluster in the center of the stage for vocals.  With nine separate channels, each vocal and instrument had its own feed and thus eliminated distortion.  The Wall allowed the band to fulfill its mission of perfect harmony with the audience, because it acted as a monitor system.  There was no longer need for the barrier of speakers at the front of the stage usually there to allow band members to hear themselves play, rather the speakers were now positioned behind the band, allowing them to hear exactly what the audience was hearing.  The Wall was the largest concert sound system build at that time, producing some of the cleanest, most powerful sound of any rock band. </p>
		<p>Although mighty in size, this technological marvel was completely impractical, costing the band almost $350,000 to develop, which was even more of an enormous sum in those days.  With overhead rising to $100,000 a month, the band was struggling to break even, and was forced to take a hiatus from touring in the fall of 1974.  The Wall of Sound was broken up during the break, some parts kept by the band, some sold, while most of it was donated to other bands in need, thusly keeping the legacy of this great sound system alive. </p>

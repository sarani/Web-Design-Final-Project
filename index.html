	    <p>The Grateful Dead was an American rock band formed in 1965 in Palo Alto, California.  Created by founding members <a href="Jerry-Garcia.html">Jerry Garcia</a>, <a href="Bob-Weir.html">Bob Weir,</a> <a href="Ron-PigPen-Mckernan.html">Ron “Pigpen McKernan</a>,<a href="Bill-Kreutzmann.html"> Bill Kreutzmann</a>, and <a href="Phil-Lesh.html">Phil Lesh</a>.  Previously known as the Warlocks, the band quickly changed its name after finding out that another band of the same name had already signed a recording contract.  The name Grateful Dead was chosen after Garcia had spontaneously picked up a dictionary and opened to a page where the definition read, “the soul of a dead person, or his angel, showing gratitude to someone who, as an act of charity, arranged their burial.”</p>
			<p>In January 1967, their first album The Grateful Dead appeared on Warner Brothers recording label.  Over the next four years, the Dead released studio experimentations, Anthem of the Sun and Aoxomoxoa, live concert footage, Live/Dead, and the acoustic albums, Workingman’s Dead and American Beauty. </p>
		<p>After sitting in and jamming with the Dead, <a href="Mickey-Hart.html">Mickey Hart</a> joined the band as the second percussionist, adding to their unique sound and tenor.  The Dead added<a href="Godchaux.html"> Keith Godchaux</a> to play piano alongside an ailing Pigpen during the last years of his life, with wife <a href="Godchaux.html">Donna Jean Godchaux</a> joining as a backup vocalist.  After Pigpen’s death due to complications from alcohol in 1972, Keith Godchaux would remain the bands solo keyboardist.</p>
		<p>After forming their own record group, Grateful Dead Records, they released their next studio album, the jazz influenced Wake of the Flood, and their biggest commercial success thus far.  Capitalizing on the Flood’s success, the next year the band released Grateful Dead from the Mars Hotel.  Not long after that, the band decided to take a brief hiatus, so members could focus on solo careers, lasting until 1976.  That same year, the band signed with Arista Records and their new contract produced Blues for Allah and Terrapin Station in 1977.   Problems began to arise with the Godchaux’s, and while touring during the late 1970’s, accompanied by the excessive vocal issues Donna had while performing live, and Keiths dependence on hard drugs, the two were asked to leave the band. </p>
		<p>Following the departure of the Godchaux’s, Brent Mydland joined the band as a keyboardist and vocalist and was considered a perfect fit to the band.  Throughout the 1980’s Mydland’s talents helped transform the band and ultimately helped power the group, however shortly after his integration, Garcia’s health began declining, and his drug habits caused him to lose liveliness on stage.  After kicking the habit however, Garcia fell into a diabetic coma for several days in 1986.  Though it took him a year to recover, the next year the band released In The Dark, which resulted as their best selling album release, and produced their only top 10 chart single “Touch of Grey.” </p>
		<p>Inspired by Garcia's improved health and the success of their album, the band's energy and chemistry peaked in the late 1980s and early 90’s. Performances were vigorous and as a result, every show exceeded its maximum audience capacity. Unfortunately, this high time came to a sudden halt when Mydland died after the summer tour in 1990, making him the third keyboardist to pass. </p>
		<p>The band was forced to rebuild once more, adding keyboardist Vince Welnick, from The Tubes.  In August 1992 Garcia was diagnosed with exhaustion and heart congestion causing the band to break up until December. Welnick stayed with the band until Garcia's death in 1995 when he was found comatose without a pulse in Serenity Knolls treatment facility.  The band discussed continuing without Garcia, but in 1995 they announced the Dead would be no more. </p>

		<p>In 2009, members Bob Weir and Phil Lesh from the Grateful Dead created the band Furthur to continue the Grateful Dead tradition of stellar playing, and free flowing improvisation that moves the mind and shakes the body.  Along with Weir and Lesh, original band members Bill Kreutzmann, and Mickey Hart teamed up with guitarist Warren Gaynes from The Allman Brothers Band, and RatDog keyboardist Jeff Chimenti to tour as the Dead.  However, after yielding erratic results, the ’09 tour reminded Weir and Lesh of the chemistry the two had as bandmates, leading to the creation of Furthur.  Accompanied by Jeff Chimenti on keys, John Kadlecik on lead guitar, and Joe Russo on Drums, the music of the Dead is still being played in theaters across the nation.</p>
		<p>Phil Lesh additionally plays with his solo band Phil Lesh and Friends, where different “friends” accompany him during different tours, some of which are members of Furthur.  Bob Weir also plays in his solo Bob Weir Band, touring as much as he can. </p>

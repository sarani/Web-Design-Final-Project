	<p>In the 1970’s a number of fans began travelling to see the band in as many shows, festivals, or venues as they could.  With large numbers of people from all over the world attending strings of shows a community was created, and Deadheads were born.  Coming together for the ritual of the live show, the tribe of fans became united by a love of the band’s music and a commitment to its egalitarian values.  These were a group of people who were so devoted to the music; they would do anything possible to keep touring with the band, from selling tie-dye t-shirts, to veggie burritos.</p>
		<p>Some even starting taping shows, and the Grateful Dead became famous for allowing their fans to record their live shows.  People would then trade those tapes with one another for free, in exchange for tapes, or a “miracle ticket,” and because of the bands improvising; every show caught on tape would be different.  Taping increased so much the band created a special section for fans who wished to record the show.  Although this decision was made in attempts to ease conflict and promte civility among the fans, it ended up being a brilliant marketing move.  Taping created a historical record of Grateful Dead shows, drew in new fans, and through generating new fans, helped the Dead make money, all while creating a community.  These tapes are still shared are circulated today, people sharing and exchanging tapes, while sharing one’s own personal and unique experience with the Grateful Dead.</p>
			
	<p>The band was not interested in simply producing great music, they wanted to create a way of life for themselves and their audience, and with the collaboration of the Deadhead’s they did exactly that.  This is what makes Deadheads so unique from another fan group, and why the Dead enjoyed their loyalty and longevity, and how this lead to the creation of a symbiotic relationship.  The band needed the fans, and the fans needed the band.  When the band faced the biggest crisis of its career, police harassment and bans from certain venues and cities, it was the fans who helped solve the problem.  Deadheads received a letter accompanying each purchased ticket asking them for help, and with that came the organization of an online community to recruit those willing to help at shows, an attempt to keep the peace and preserve the Deadheads’ reputation in the communities where they played.</p><!-- InstanceEndEditable --> </div>
